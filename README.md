  * /!!\ You should get an error message saying the file is damaged: go to (your Mac) System Preference / Security and confidentiality and choose "Allow downloaded applications from anywhere". Re-open the file and say that you want to open it (don't be afraid, the file is safe). Once it's done you can set your preferences to the previous ones.
  * If the Allow option is not available (default case on latest Mac), you need to open the Terminal application and type the command `sudo spctl --master-disable`
